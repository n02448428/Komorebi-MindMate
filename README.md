## What It Does

Komorebi MindMate is a personal AI wellness app built around the concept of *komorebi* (the Japanese word for sunlight filtering through leaves) — a moment of calm, clarity, and reflection. Users can:

- Have open-ended AI-powered conversations for mental clarity and emotional support
- Save chat sessions and revisit them in a searchable **Chat Archive**
- Generate and browse **AI Insights** extracted from past sessions
- Manage their account and upgrade to a **Pro tier** with extended features
- Access everything securely via **Supabase Auth**

## Why I Built This

I wanted to explore what a genuinely useful AI companion could look like — not just a chatbot, but something that helps users build self-awareness over time. Komorebi MindMate is the result: a full production-grade app with auth, a real database, AI integration, and a tiered business model.
