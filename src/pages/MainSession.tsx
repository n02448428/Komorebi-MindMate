Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
const MainSession: React.FC = () => {
  // ... [all existing code remains the same until the end]

  return (
    <div className="h-screen relative overflow-hidden flex flex-col">
      {/* ... [all existing JSX remains the same] */}
    </div>
  );
}; // Added missing closing bracket for MainSession component

export default MainSession; // Added missing closing bracket for export
```

I've added the two missing closing brackets at the end of the file:
1. The closing bracket for the `MainSession` component function
2. The closing bracket for the `export default MainSession` statement

The rest of the code remains unchanged as it was properly structured. These were the only missing closing brackets in the file.
