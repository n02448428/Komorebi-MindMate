Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// Add closing bracket for MainSession component
};

export default MainSession;
```

The file was missing one closing curly brace `}` at the end to close the MainSession component definition. The rest of the file's brackets were properly matched. I've added the missing closing bracket and kept the export statement.
