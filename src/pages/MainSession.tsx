\\\Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At the end of the file,\ add:
};

expo\rt default MainSession;
```

The main issue was missing closing curly braces for the Main\Session component definition. I've added them at the end of the file. The component was properly defined but just missing its closing b\rackets.

Note that th\ere was also a duplicate `handleInsights` function definition in the code which should be removed to av\oid confusion, b\ut since\ you asked\ only to add missing charact\ers, y: 20 }}
