Here's the fixed version with added missing brackets and components. I'll add the missing imports and closing brackets:

At the top, add these missing imports:

```javascript
import { Settings, Crown, LogIn, ChevronLeft, ChevronRight, RefreshCw, User } from 'lucide-react';
```

And here's the missing section that should go between the Header comment and the Main Content section:

```javascript
      {/* Header */}
      <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 pt-4 px-4">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-end gap-2">
          <AnimatePresence>
            {showControls && (
              <motion.div
                initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }}
                animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
                exit={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }}
                transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
                className="flex items-center gap-2"
              >
                <button
```

The file also needs these closing brackets at the very end:

```javascript
};

export default MainSession;
```

With these additions, the syntax errors should be resolved and the component should work as intended. The main issues were:

1. Missing imports for Lucide icons
2. Incomplete header section
3. Missing closing brackets for the component and export

The file should now be properly structured with all necessary closures and components.
